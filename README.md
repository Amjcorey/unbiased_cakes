# Week-2 Challenge

# Description
The motivation behind this project was to build out a rough outline for my portfolio. This space will provide a solid platform to showcase projects and abilities to potential employers and customers alike. This process allowed me to see how much room there is to grow within web development, and also about the power of creating a personal brand.

# Features
Features of this page include a nav bar with links that send you to their corresponding information within the web page (ie. to sections 'About Me', my 'Work', and a 'Contact-Me' area). Within the work area, there are images with project numbers above them; when the images are clicked, the site will send users directly to those deployed applications. The Contact Me section works much the same way as the nav bar; when certain elements are clicked (GitHub, Linkden) the user will be taken directly to those URLs.
